# Welcome to Our Guide!

When you decide to dive into the Linux universe, you quickly discover that there isn't just one Linux, but dozens, even hundreds of distributions (or "distros"). Each has its specific features, its target audience, and most importantly, its level of difficulty.

Whether you're just curious, a developer wanting to move beyond Windows or macOS, or an enthusiast eager to deeply understand how an operating system works, there's a Linux distribution for you. In this article, we'll compare the main distributions according to their complexity level, to help you choose the one that best suits your profile and objectives.

<br>

## I. Why So Many Different Distributions?

Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is an open ecosystem where each community can create its own version of the system. This diversity is a richness that allows everyone to find the environment that suits them best. However, this abundance of choice can also be confusing for new users.

The key is to understand that all these distributions share the same Linux kernel, but differ in:
- **User interface**: some prioritize simplicity, others customization
